The first file that Ive added to our project 222 Different Branch
sssssssnewwwfor the merge
It comes before all other files.
It's showing me pages of results and in fact if I scroll this up like this, you can see that it's now asking me. Here, it's prompting me, waiting for me to hit the spacebar to show me the rest of the results, and I can use F and B to go forwards and backwards through those results. What this is the less pager that's built into UNIX. So I'm using the less pager to see these results. The less pager has a feature where I can either start it up using the -R command, and you can set that in your global configuration or while I'm inside of it I can press the minus key and then Shift+S and then hit Return, and it will fold those long lines.

So if you prefer instead of saying one line above the other, you prefer having it actually color the output for you so you can see the difference between them, you can use the color-words option. So we have seen
